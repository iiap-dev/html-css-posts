The main functionality that was implemented is **loading more posts** on demand combined with **pagination**, reflected in a query string. 
The idea was to gradually add 6 cards per page, so each page has a certain amount of posts.

For design, only hero section and card samples were provided in Figma. Fonts, sizes and colors were set up accordingly, while other resolutions and behaviour was designed to match given file.
